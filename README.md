Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

## Files

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables and the data contained in the `tidy_data.txt`.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called `tidy_data.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.

## run_analysis.R

The cleanup script (run_analysis.R) does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
